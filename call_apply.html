<!--
Apply uses Arrays and Always takes one or two Arguments. When you use Call you have to Count the number of arguments.
-->

<!--
use apply if you don't know the number of arguments you will be passing, or if they are already in an array or array-like object (like the arguments object to forward your own arguments. 
-->

<!--Use call otherwise, since there's no need to wrap the arguments in an array.-->

<!--Both call and apply perform very similar functions: they execute a function in the context, or scope, of the first argument that you pass to them.-->

<!-- they're both functions that can only be called on other functions. -->

<script>
function Class () {}
Class.prototype.calc = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Create 2 instances:
var ins1 = new Class(),
    ins2 = new Class();

// Test the calc method:
console.log(ins1.calc(1,1), ins2.calc(1,1));
// -> 2, 2

// Change the prototype method
Class.prototype.calc = function () {
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments),
        res = 0, c;

    while (c = args.shift()){
    	console.log(c);
        res += c;
    }

    return res; 
}

// Test the calc method:
console.log(ins1.calc(1,1,1), ins2.calc(1,1,1));
// -> 3, 3
</script>
<!--
ins1 and ins2 share the same calc() function.
-->
<!--
creating methods inside the constructor is poorer performance. 
Each method has to be created every time the constructor function runs.
-->
<!--
Methods on the prototype chain are created once and then "inherited" by each instance.
-->
<!--
 public methods have access to "private" variables, which isn't possible with inherited methods.
 -->
 <!--
 Advantages of prototype methods:

When you define methods via prototype, they are shared among all YourClass instances. As a result the total size of such instances is < than if you define methods in constructor; There are tests that show how method definition via prototype decrease the total size of html page and as a result a speed of its loading.

another advantage of methods, defined via prototype - is when you use inherited classes, you may override such methods and in the overriden method of the derived class you may invoke the method of base class with the same name, but with methods defined in constructor, you cannot do this.

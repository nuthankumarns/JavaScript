<!-- passing in a primitive type variable like a string or a number, the value is passed in by value. 
	This means that any changes to that variable while in the function are completely separate from anything that happens outside the function. -->
	<script>
	console.log(x) //x is hoisted and is equal to 4
		function myfunction(x)
		{
      // x is equal to 4
      x = 5;
      // x is now equal to 5
  }

  var x = 4;// var x is hoisted
console.log(x); // x is equal to 4
myfunction(x); 
console.log(x); // x is still equal to 4
</script>

<!--Passing in an object, however, passes it in by reference.
	In this case, any property of that object is accessible within the function.-->
	<script>
		function myobject()
		{
			this.value = 5;
		}
		var o = new myobject();
		console.log(o.value); // o.value = 5
		function objectchanger(fnc)
		{
			fnc.value = 6;
		}
		objectchanger(o);
		console.log(o.value); // o.value is now equal to 6
</script>

<!--Method of an object would be passed by reference allowing the method to access other parts of the object it is apart of-->
<script>
	function myobject()
	{
		this.value = 5;
	}
	myobject.prototype.add = function()
	{
		this.value++;
	}
	var o = new myobject();
console.log(o.value); // o.value = 5
o.add();
console.log(o.value); // o.value = 6 
function objectchanger(fnc)
{
	fnc(); // runs the function being passed in
}
objectchanger(o.add);
console.log(o.value); // sorry, still just 6 expected it to be 7 right?!!??

</script>
<!--The problem here is the use of the ‘this’ keyword. It’s a handy short-hand for referring to the current object context. When passing a function as a parameter, though, the context is lost. More accurately, this now refers to the context of the object making the call instead of the object’s function we just passed in.-->


<!--Option 1: When you know the method-->
<!--pass in the object instead of the function and call that instead. Using the objectchanger from the last example you’d get the following:-->
<script>
	function objectchanger(obj)
	{
	obj.add(); // runs the method of the object being passed in
}
objectchanger(o);
console.log(o.value); // the value is now 7

</script>

<!--Option 2: When you don’t know the method-->
<!--pass both the method and the object as parameters and use the call method. call is part of the JavaScript specification and allows a function to run in the context of another object. As a result, the this keyword will reference the right object: the object we passed in.-->
<script>
	function objectchanger(fnc, obj)
	{
	fnc.call(obj); // runs the method of the object being passed in
}
objectchanger(o.add, o);
console.log(o.value); // the value is now 7
</script>

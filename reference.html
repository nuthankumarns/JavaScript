<script>
var x = 0;
function a(x)
{
    x++;
}
a(x);
console.log(x); //Here I want to have 1 instead of 0
</script>
<!--
In this case, x is a reference to an object. When x is passed to the function a, that reference is copied over to obj. Thus, obj and x refer to the same thing in memory. Changing the Value property of obj affects the Value property of x.
-->



<!--
Javascript will always pass function parameters by value. That's simply a specification of the language. You could create x in a scope local to both functions, and not pass the variable at all.
-->

<script>
var x = {Value: 0};

function a(obj)
{
    obj.Value++;
}

a(x);
console.log(x.Value); //Here i want to have 1 instead of 0
</script>
